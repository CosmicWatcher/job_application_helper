Integrate keywords naturally (avoid keyword stuffing). Incorporate Metrics wherever possible. follow STAR, XYZ, or CAR methods when writing the suggestions. Don't use personal pronouns. Don't end bullet points with periods. Don't mention the company in the job description. Each suggestion should begin with a strong, past-tense action verb. only show me the best 6 suggestions. each suggestion should start on a new line and have \\item at the beginning of the line. the final output must only contain the 6 suggestions, no other text. in the bullet point avoid mentioning what it demonstrates. the output format must be \\item bullet_point ## why_you_chose_this_bullet_point."
