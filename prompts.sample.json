Integrate keywords naturally (avoid keyword stuffing). Incorporate Metrics wherever possible. follow STAR, XYZ, or CAR methods when writing the suggestions. Don't use personal pronouns. Don't end bullet points with periods. Each suggestion should begin with a strong, past-tense action verb. only show me the best 6 suggestions. each suggestion should start on a new line and have \\item at the beginning of the line. at the end of each suggestion include a comment starting with ## with a brief explanation of why you chose that suggestion. the final output must only contain the 6 suggestions, no other text."
