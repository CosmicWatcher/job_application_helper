Don't use personal pronouns. Don't end bullet points with periods. Each suggestion should begin with a strong, past-tense action verb. only show me the best 6 suggestions. each suggestion should start on a new line and have \\item at the beginning of the line. the final output must only contain the 6 suggestions, no other text."
